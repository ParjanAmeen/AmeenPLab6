Clearly, every binary search tree is a binary tree. 
The height of a binary search tree is determined in the same way as the height of a binary tree. 
Similarly, the operations to find the number of nodes, 
to find the number of leaves, and to do inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals 
of a binary search tree are the same as those for a binary tree. 
Therefore, we can inherit all of these operations from the binary tree. 
That is, we can extend the definition of the binary tree 
by using the principle of inheritance and hence define the binary search tree.
